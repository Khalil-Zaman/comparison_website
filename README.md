# comparison_website
In 2013, after watching thenewboston's videos on php, html, css, javascript and mysql, I decided to create a comparison website which allows people to compare products side by side and rate which is better. 

Developing the website helped develop my abilities in the languages, but after a year of being online, it turned out not to be a success, and I've since then left it. 

I still think it's a great idea, I think a mobile application would do better, alongside with some advertising.
